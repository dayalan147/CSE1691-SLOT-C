.Covariance and correlation 
Children of three ages are asked to indicate their preference for three photographs of adults. Do the data suggest that there is a significant relationship between age and photograph preference? What is wrong with this study?

5-6 years:      18                     22                     20

7-8 years:         2                    28                     40

9-10 years:     20                     10                     40

1.	Use cov() to calculate the sample covariance between B  and  C.
2.	Use another call to cov() to calculate the sample covariance matrix for the preferences.
3.	Use cor() to calculate the sample correlation between B and C.
4.	Use another call to cor() to calculate the sample correlation matrix for the preferences.
